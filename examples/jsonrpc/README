jquery.terminal example - JSON-RPC

This example do NOT attempt to explain how to build a JSON-RPC endpoint.

You need Node.js to run this example because of the same origin policy.

	node index.js

then go on

	http://localhost:8080/

The  log  command sends data to the server through the endpoint,
that simply displays them on the console.

It uses a modified version of https://github.com/andris9/node-jsonrpc
(only on the server side).

You may use other technologies as well
(see http://json-rpc.org/wiki/implementations).
